## introduction

A Firefox extension that allows the user to search DuckDuckGo in a way which is identical to the usual DuckDuckGo search with two main exceptions:

1. **"Safe search" is disabled.** This is the main point of the extension. There will be one less algorithm deciding for you what is appropriate viewing. 

   Of course you may always use the [Safe Search page](https://safe.duckduckgo.com/) or change the settings on a per-search basis if for some reason you want this function. Read [about safe search](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/safe-search/).

2. **Region-specific results are disabled**. Can be enabled on a per-search basis. Read [about regional search](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/settings/regions/).

You do not need this extension to accomplish either of these goals. It is merely a convenience. 

## this is primarily for my own learning

While I do truly *despise* enforced safe search, at the moment the purpose of this repo is to learn about git hub, software development process and such. 

If (for some reason) you are nosing around in here and you see all the issue requests, documentation, planning and such for such a tiny amount of code, this is why. :)

Please feel free to open an issue should you so desire. My capabilities to do anything are extremely limited. 



## installation

[tbd issue #1]



## useage notes



### omnibox search

the omnibox search is `ddl` so you can have regular duckduckgo (`ddg`) installed concurrently without interfering with it's behaviour. 

### Privacy

This extension merely formats your request from the location/search box to include the parameters described above DuckDuckGo. The information does not go anywhere else, or do anything other than it otherwise would.
